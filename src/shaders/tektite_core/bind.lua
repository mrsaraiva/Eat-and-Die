-- In the compound case, there are two special ways to call the event:
--
-- * If **"n"** is the first argument, returns the number of component events, _n_.
-- * If **"i"** is the first argument, the second argument, _i_, is interpreted as an index.
-- If _i_ is an integer &isin; [1, _n_], returns compound event #_i_; otherwise, **nil**.
--
-- Otherwise, each component event is called with the compound event's arguments.
--
-- **N.B.** Individually, if called with **"n"** as its first argument, any _event_ is
-- expected to be a no-op.
--
-- It is intended that _builder_ be passed as the _func_ argument to @{Subscribe}, with
-- _object_ passed alongside it as _arg_.
