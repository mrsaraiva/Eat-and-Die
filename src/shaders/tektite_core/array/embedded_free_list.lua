--- This module is motivated by the fact that, when an array's elements are required to be
-- non-numbers, said elements may be removed without disturbing the positions of elements
-- elsewhere in the array, by stuffing an integer into the vacated slot.
--
-- Furthermore, these same integers can be used to maintain a free list, thus providing O(1)
-- retrieval of free array slots.
